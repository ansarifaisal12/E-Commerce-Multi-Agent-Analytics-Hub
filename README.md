These agents analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to deliver actionable recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get data-driven recommendations from specialized AI agents
- **Sample Data Generation**: Automatically generates sample data if no CSV files are found
- **Customizable**: Add your own datasets or modify the existing ones for personalized analysis

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed
2. A **Groq API key** (sign up at [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-dashboard.git
   cd ecommerce-analytics-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your Groq API key:**

   **Option 1:** Set an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

   **Option 2:** Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **(Optional) Add your own CSV files to the project directory:**
   - `customers.csv`
